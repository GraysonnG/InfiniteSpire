# Infinite Spire
A mod for Slay the Spire that adds the ability to climb forever and adds a perk tree.

## Description
Primarily this mod is an expansion mod that adds lots of new content, like new relics, cards, events, bosses. One of the other goals of this mod was to integrate it with as many mods as possible. This mod also allows the player to keep climbing after the 3rd floor even on normal runs. After 3 floors completed, you will be able to purchase some perks from the portal. Perks are bought with the silver you earn as you defeat enemies. Keep in mind this basically means you are permanently in infinite mode.

Infinite Spire isn't supposed to increase the difficulty of the game, it is just there to enhance the game by adding new interactions and fun new mechnaics.
