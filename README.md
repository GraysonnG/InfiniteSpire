# Infinite Spire
A mod for Slay the Spire that adds the ability to climb forever and adds a perk tree.

## Description
This mod allows the player to keep climbing after the 3rd floor, increasing in ascension. After 3 floors completed, you will be able to purchase a perk. Perks are bought with the points you earn as you climb the spire.

Infinite Spire isn't supposed to increase the difficulty of the game, it is just there to let you keep fighting the spire when you have a fun deck.

## Requirements
- Java 8 (Mod The Spire has issues with Java 9)

## Installation
- Install/Update [ModTheSpire](https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases/latest)

## Roadmap
- Customize the climb to increase in difficulty more quickly.
- Add perks and a perk tree GUI to the game.
- Implement some fun cards and relics for the current classes to work with the infinite climb.
